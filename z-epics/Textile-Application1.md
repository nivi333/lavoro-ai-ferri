### **Theme Toggle Implementation Details**

#### Components
- **ThemeContext**: Located at `/frontend/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
  - Manages theme state (light/dark) using React Context API
  - Persists theme preference in localStorage
  - Provides `theme`, `setTheme`, and `toggle` functions
  - Automatically detects system preference on first load
  - Adds 'dark' class to body element for CSS targeting

- **ThemeToggle Component**: Located at `/frontend/src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx`
  - Uses Ant Design Switch with SunOutlined/MoonOutlined icons
  - Positioned in header before other action buttons
  - Smooth transition between themes (300ms)

- **MainLayout Integration**: Consistent placement across all authenticated screens

#### Theme Configuration
- **Light Mode (Default)**:
  - Background: #f5f5f5 (Light Gray)
  - Surface: #ffffff (White)
  - Text: #000000 (Black)
  - Primary: #7b5fc9 (Purple)
  - Accent: #a2d8e5 (Light Blue)
  - Success: #52c41a (Green)
  - Error: #ff4d4f (Red)
  - Warning: #faad14 (Orange)

- **Dark Mode**:
  - Background: #121212 (Dark Gray)
  - Surface: #1f1f1f (Slightly lighter gray)
  - Text: #ffffff (White)
  - Primary: #9b7fe9 (Lighter Purple)
  - Accent: #c2f8ff (Lighter Blue)
  - Success: #73d13d (Lighter Green)
  - Error: #ff7875 (Lighter Red)
  - Warning: #ffc53d (Lighter Orange)

#### SCSS Variables Structure
- **Base Variables**: Located at `/frontend/src/index.scss`
  - Primary colors, text colors, background colors defined at top
  - Dark mode variables defined with $dark- prefix
  - Component-specific variables derived from base variables

#### Dark Mode Implementation
- **CSS Approach**: Uses CSS variables and SCSS nesting
- **Selector Pattern**: `[data-theme='dark']` for global styles
- **Component Patterns**:
  - Global styles in index.scss
  - Component-specific dark mode styles in component SCSS files
  - Consistent use of SCSS variables for colors

#### Tag Styling in Dark Mode
- **Tag Colors**: Updated to match light mode color scheme
  - Success tags: Green text on light green background
  - Warning tags: Orange text on light orange background
  - Error tags: Red text on light red background
  - Processing tags: Purple text on light purple background
- **Consistency**: Same color scheme in both light and dark modes
- **Implementation**: Updated in `/frontend/src/index.scss`

#### Recent Improvements
- Fixed dark mode tag styling to use consistent colors across modes
- Updated purchase order drawer padding to match product drawer
- Improved drawer header styling with consistent spacing
- Fixed text contrast issues in dark mode for better readability

#### Known Issues
- Some components still use inline styles instead of theme variables
- Background colors in some components don't properly adapt to dark mode
- Text contrast issues in specific components in dark mode

- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with breakpoints at 768px, 1024px
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### **Form Guidelines**
- [ ] **< 5 fields**: Modal
- [ ] **5-20 fields**: Drawer component
- [ ] **> 20 fields**: Separate screen/wizard
- [ ] **Action Buttons**: Cancel & Save always at bottom
- [ ] **Consistent Placement**: Same button order across all forms

### **Table Guidelines**
- [ ] **Actions**: Multiple actions in "More" menu (three dots icon)
- [ ] **Icons**: Ant Design icons only
- [ ] **Pagination**: Standard pagination (10, 25, 50, 100 per page)
- [ ] **Empty States**: Ant Design Empty component with clear call-to-action

### **Active Toggle Pattern**

## 📋 Project Development Standards

### **UI/UX Standards**
- [ ] Reuse existing components  
- [ ] Follow theme variables (primary: #7b5fc9, accent: #a2d8e5)
- [ ] SCSS only, no inline styles
- [ ] Follow existing naming conventions
- [ ] Match current code structure and patterns
- [ ] Logo always top-left
- [ ] Buttons: medium/small only
- [ ] Forms: 5-20 fields = drawer, <5 = modal, >20 = page
- [ ] **MainLayout Requirement**: ALL post-company-selection screens MUST be wrapped in MainLayout component to display sidebar and header
- [ ] **Sidebar Configuration**: All screens must be added to sidebar navigation in navigationConfig.ts

### **Multi-Tenant Security & Data Isolation (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Every API endpoint and service method MUST filter data by company_id (tenantId)
- [ ] **Backend Services**: All get*, create*, update*, delete* methods MUST accept companyId as first parameter
- [ ] **Controllers**: All protected routes MUST use req.tenantId from JWT token for company context
- [ ] **Database Queries**: ALL queries MUST include where: { company_id: companyId } filter
- [ ] **Role-Based Access**: Combine company filtering with role checks using requireRole middleware
- [ ] **Frontend**: All API calls post-company-selection MUST include company context from auth token
- [ ] **No Cross-Tenant Data Leaks**: Users can ONLY see/modify data from companies they have access to
- [ ] **ID Generation**: Use globally unique IDs but always filter by company when querying
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Log all company-scoped operations with userId, tenantId, and action

### **API Design Patterns**
- [ ] **Company Context**: Use current company from JWT (req.tenantId) instead of URL params
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Provide specific, actionable error messages
- [ ] **Validation**: Check company context before role permissions in middleware chain
- [ ] **Naming Convention**: Backend uses snake_case, Frontend uses camelCase, Service layer converts between them

### **Component Patterns**
- [ ] Find and read the EXACT reference component before making changes
- [ ] Copy the EXACT structure - same imports, same layout, same styling approach
- [ ] Copy the EXACT CSS approach - reuse existing SCSS, no new files unless necessary
- [ ] Copy the EXACT button/action pattern - same buttons, same positioning
- [ ] Only change field names and labels - nothing else
- [ ] Do NOT create new files or new CSS for existing styles, reuse className

- [✅] **Dyeing & Finishing Edit Mode**: Fixed API call from POST to PUT when editing existing records
  - Issue: Edit drawer was calling create API instead of update API
  - Fix: Updated `DyeingFinishingDrawer.tsx` to use `processId` from `initialData` for update calls
  - Fixed: `DyeingFinishingListPage.tsx` to pass `mode` and `processId` props correctly
- [✅] **Color Preview in Dyeing & Finishing**: Fixed color picker to display actual color code
  - Issue: Color preview showing black instead of actual color (e.g., brown #A52A2A)
  - Fix: Added `onChange` handler to Input field to properly sync with ColorPicker component
  - Result: Color picker now correctly displays and updates the hex color value
- [✅] **Quality Check Toggle Help Text**: Added tooltip and info icon for clarity
  - Issue: Users confused about Quality Check toggle meaning
  - Fix: Added info icon (ⓘ) with tooltip explaining "Enable to indicate this batch passed quality inspection"
  - Added: Form.Item tooltip property with detailed on/off state explanation
- [✅] **Design & Patterns isActive Field**: Fixed backend to return isActive in API responses
  - Issue: Backend `mapDesignToDTO` not including `isActive` field
  - Fix: Added `isActive: design.is_active` to DTO mapping in `textileService.ts`
  - Result: Frontend now correctly displays active/inactive status for designs
- [✅] **Design & Patterns Edit Error**: Fixed "Design not found" error when editing
  - Issue: Frontend passing UUID `id` instead of `designId` (auto-generated code like DES001)
  - Fix: Updated `DesignPatternsListPage.tsx` to pass `designId` instead of `id` to drawer
  - Result: Edit mode now correctly loads design data
- [✅] **Inactive Tag Color**: Changed from grey to orange globally for better visibility
  - Issue: Grey color too common, hard to distinguish inactive status
  - Fix: Updated all list pages (Fabric, Yarn, Dyeing, Garment, Design, Products) to use `color='orange'` for inactive tags
  - Result: Inactive status now clearly visible with orange color across all modules
- [✅] **Backend ID Consistency**: Fixed all textile service methods to use correct ID fields
  - Issue: `getById` and `delete` methods using UUID instead of auto-generated codes
  - Fix: Updated all methods to use `fabric_id`, `yarn_id`, `process_id`, `garment_id`, `design_id` for lookups
  - Affected: `getFabricById`, `deleteFabric`, `getYarnById`, `deleteYarn`, `getDyeingById`, `deleteDyeing`, `getGarmentById`, `deleteGarment`, `getDesignById`, `deleteDesign`
  - Result: All CRUD operations now work consistently with auto-generated codes
