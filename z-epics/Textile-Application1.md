## 📋 Project Development Standards

### **UI/UX Standards**
- [ ] Reuse existing components  
- [ ] Follow theme variables (primary: #7b5fc9, accent: #a2d8e5)
- [ ] SCSS only, no inline styles
- [ ] Follow existing naming conventions
- [ ] Match current code structure and patterns
- [ ] Logo always top-left
- [ ] Buttons: medium/small only
- [ ] Forms: 5-20 fields = drawer, <5 = modal, >20 = page
- [ ] **MainLayout Requirement**: ALL post-company-selection screens MUST be wrapped in MainLayout component to display sidebar and header
- [ ] **Sidebar Configuration**: All screens must be added to sidebar navigation in navigationConfig.ts

### **Multi-Tenant Security & Data Isolation (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Every API endpoint and service method MUST filter data by company_id (tenantId)
- [ ] **Backend Services**: All get*, create*, update*, delete* methods MUST accept companyId as first parameter
- [ ] **Controllers**: All protected routes MUST use req.tenantId from JWT token for company context
- [ ] **Database Queries**: ALL queries MUST include where: { company_id: companyId } filter
- [ ] **Role-Based Access**: Combine company filtering with role checks using requireRole middleware
- [ ] **Frontend**: All API calls post-company-selection MUST include company context from auth token
- [ ] **No Cross-Tenant Data Leaks**: Users can ONLY see/modify data from companies they have access to
- [ ] **ID Generation**: Use globally unique IDs but always filter by company when querying
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: Log all company-scoped operations with userId, tenantId, and action

### **API Design Patterns**
- [ ] **Company Context**: Use current company from JWT (req.tenantId) instead of URL params
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Provide specific, actionable error messages
- [ ] **Validation**: Check company context before role permissions in middleware chain
- [ ] **Naming Convention**: Backend uses snake_case, Frontend uses camelCase, Service layer converts between them

### **Component Patterns**
- [ ] Find and read the EXACT reference component before making changes
- [ ] Copy the EXACT structure - same imports, same layout, same styling approach
- [ ] Copy the EXACT CSS approach - reuse existing SCSS, no new files unless necessary
- [ ] Copy the EXACT button/action pattern - same buttons, same positioning
- [ ] Only change field names and labels - nothing else
- [ ] Do NOT create new files or new CSS for existing styles, reuse className
